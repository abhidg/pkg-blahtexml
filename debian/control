Description: Converts TeX equations into MathML
 Blahtex converts an equation given in a syntax close to TeX into
 MathML. Blahtexml is a simple extension of blahtex. In addition to
 the functionality of blahtex, blahtexml has XML processing in mind
 and is able to process a whole XML document into another XML
 document. Instead of converting only one formula at a time, blahtexml
 can convert all the formulas of the given XML file into MathML.
